# Doors-Smores-Docs

Doors Smores is intended as a simplified software documentation and requirements management tool. The project is born both out of a frustration at the state of existing tools, and the belief that for the majority of projects, commercial tools such as IBM DOORS and Windchill RV&S are both overkill and overpriced.

Doors Smores takes things back to basics.
- VS Code provides the main interface elements
- A document is simply a collection of nodes with child/parent relationships
- Doors Smores stores the data for those notes in a combination of JSON and text files
- Changes to the project are automatically committed to Git to provide version control

This project provides documentation on the [Doors Smores VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Niflheim.doors-smores).
